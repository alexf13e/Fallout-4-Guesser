## Redistribution and stuff

If you *really* want to use the code in here, that's fine. I guess.<br>
I have commented where a bit of code is literally just copied from somewhere, and I'm pretty sure none of it required a license of any sort (certainly hope so).<br>
But there are likely many issues with it, and I take no responsibility if you accidentally summon a portal to the underworld with it (or any other problems it may cause).<br>
Maybe I'll make an engine type thing so having this kind of game be implemented for other game worlds could be done more easily, instead of completely making a game from scratch, but I doubt anyone really cares, and the few that do wouldn't have much issue just making their own game. I mean, that's what I did and it only took a year to make it somewhat not crap.
