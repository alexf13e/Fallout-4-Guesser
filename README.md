## Redistribution and stuff
I have no problem with anyone reusing this code as the basis for their own similar style games, though if you make something and upload it I would appreciate a link back here (and I'd like to see what you make too, I'm sure it will be better than my one).
I'd rather if whatever you make is kept free and open, but it's not like I can do anything if you don't.
