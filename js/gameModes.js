        Curve is tuned to have max score at 5 metres, and 0 points at 500 metres
        https://www.desmos.com/calculator/nvdbx3r4qx (b is scoreStrictness)
        Vague explanation about how its tuned:
        ax^2 + bx + c = score (x = distance in metres)

        (we want to find a, b and c which will give a curve suiting our needs (goes through 5000 points at 5 metres, and 0 points at 500 metres))
        a(5^2) + b(5) + c = 5000
        a(500^2) + b(500) + c = 0

        c = -a(500^2) - b(500) = 5000 - a(5^2) - b(5)
        (ignore c for now)
        5000 = a(5^2) - a(500^2) + b(5) - b(500)
        5000 = a(500^2 - 5^2) + b(500 - 5)
        5000 = a(250,000 - 25) + b(495)
        5000 = 249,975a + 495b

        (decide to tune based on b since it is nicer for adjusting the curve. so we want a as a function of b)
        249,975a = 5000 - 495b
        a = (5000 - 495b) / 249,975

        (b is set to whatever we want to tune the curve, named scoreStrictness here)

        c = 5000 - a(5^2) - b(5^2)

        I found b = -3.9 to be reasonable for the size of the map
